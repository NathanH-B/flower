          <div class="quote">I think it’s important for everybody, whether you become a botanical artist or not, to get to experience plants in so many ways, and botanical drawing is a really nice way to get into that world.</div>

          <div class="quote">The first thing I did in my home furnishing textile design was put my new botanical skills to work. I started doing a line of very botanical detailed designs for dinnerware and bedding and different kinds of home furnishing fabric.</div>

          <div class="quote">It’s kind of a sad state of affairs that people are not allowed to have a hobby anymore, something that they do just for the pleasure of it. It shouldn’t matter if you are any good at it or not. It should just be that you want to do it and enjoy it and learn from it and try something and see where it takes you. We often don’t allow ourselves that option. We think we have to be masters before we even begin.</div>

          <div class="quote">I hope to show people that the slow act of repetitive drawing is like a meditation and it quiets that negative voice. I invite them into that kind of free creative space, and it really helps because everybody has those voices inside of them and it’s not a helpful voice.</div>

          <div class="quote">Plants were a great subject because, unlike people, the plants were cooperative and actually stood still.</div>

          <a href="#fruits"><div class="quoteimage" id="lemonsliced"></div></a>
          <div class="quote">It’s almost like the plant and you become one. I know that sounds a little cliché, but I feel that—that my hand is doing the drawing, but the plant is dictating it and helping me. I’m getting to go inside that world, almost like an insect does, and experience the plant. It’s very powerful. If I’m having a rough day it’s like, “Just go and draw for an hour. You know you’ll feel better,” and I do.</div>

          <div class="quote">I loved being outside with nature, and I was inspired early by my mom’s gardens and wanted to draw her flowers.</div>

          <a href="#fruits"><div class="quoteimage" id="cherry"></div></a>
          <div class="quote">I wanted to keep the process alive and in the moment, because what I care about is that interaction between you and the plant and what happens there. I don’t really care about a finished piece necessarily.</div>

          <div class="quote">I have a lot of inspiration right there on the farm to draw from, and my son is also a full-time farmer right in the area and he grows all kinds of stuff that I get to use. I started workshops on the farm so people can come and get the full experience of the immersion in botanical drawing, then we cook them lunch from what’s growing on the farm so you can really experience everything.</div>
